      <p class="objective"><i><br>This portfolio is more than just a collection of projects, it’s a living space where my technical 
        skills meet creative expression. Every page, every layout, and every line of code reflects my journey as a learner 
        who’s constantly exploring how technology can solve real-world problems and tell meaningful stories. This portfolio 
        also reflects my values: clarity, resilience, and connection. I believe that good design isn’t just about aesthetics, 
        it’s about making people feel understood. That’s why I’ve included reflections alongside my projects, sharing what I 
        learned, what I struggled with, and how I grew. It’s not just about showing what I can do—it’s about showing who I am 
        when I’m doing it.</i></p>
      <h3>Who I Am ୨ৎ</h3>
      <p class="objective">	Hi, I'm Shainey Rose Selgas, 2nd year college student at Cebu Technological University - Main
	        Campus. Currently taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a curious mind and a passion for both 
	        logic and creativity. I thrive at the intersection of technology and human experience, where code meets purpose and 
          design meets emotion. But beyond the technical side, I’m someone who believes that technology should spark emotion. 
          They reflect not just my skills, but my personality: detail-oriented, imaginative, and driven to make experiences 
          meaningful. I want my work to show not only what I can build, but also who I am, someone who's excited to keep learning, 
          experimenting, and sharing my story through every project. My journey is about growth, clarity, and building projects that 
          reflect both my skills and my personality. I’m proud of where I come from, and I’m excited about where my curiosity and 
          creativity will take me next.</p>
      <h3>What I Do ୨ৎ</h3>
      <p class="objective">	I aim to create digital experiences that are not only functional but also meaningful. My goal is to 
	        build projects that reflect not just skill, but soul work that feels personal, purposeful, and impactful. I love turning 
          ideas into projects that feel both functional and joyful I’m excited to keep learning, keep building, and keep shining. 
	        I believe that technology isn't just about solving problems it's about creating experiences that connect, inspire, and 
          empower. I approach every challenge with persistence and a growth mindset. I believe that technical mastery is only half 
          the story, what truly matters is making ideas resonate.</p>
      <h3>What Makes Me Unique ୨ৎ</h3>
      <p class="objective">	I believe we have many different ways to make us unique, in my case my strength lies in making complex 
          ideas feel simple and delightful. I’m not just a coder—I’m a creator who loves making technology feel alive. My work blends 
          logic and emotion, precision and playfulness.	What sets me apart is my ability to see both the structure and the story. 
          I’m methodical when solving technical problems, but I also think about how users will feel when they interact with my work. 
          I believe that good design should surprise, delight, and connect—and I build with that in mind. And most of all, I care. I 
          care about how things work, how they look, and how they make people feel. That’s what makes me unique—not just the skills 
          I’ve learned, but the heart I bring to every project.</p>
